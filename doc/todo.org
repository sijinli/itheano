* History
** DONE divide the gradients by the number of samples
** DONE divide the cost by the number of sample
** DONE test resume network
** DONE add weight vs gradient comparison
** DONE plot for testfreq != 1 

* TODO 
** TODO add module for weight init
** CANCELED Decide whether to multiply the coeff for displaying (small problem)
** TODO add mini-batch support for basicbp solver
** TODO How to do with layer with weights (Somethings I might forget to add them into the list when modifying the network architectures)
** TODO Maybe we can allow dropout layer to share the same mask?
